<h2>CREATING UNITY WITHIN OUR SCHOOL</h2>

    </section>
    <section id="aboutsustxt">

        <p>I want to make and redesign school items like T-shirts and sportswear.
            I want to give our school a clothing brand and make clothes that people want.
            To do this, I will try to design low-key clothes that match what is 'in' these days.
            I also want to change the school website and give it a better look by adding a place where these clothes are sold (I will prototype my website).
            </p>
<p>I have a lot of connections with mediamatikers who would support me in this area.
    It would be a dream to see people walking around the new KUE campus wearing my clothes and it would bring the school together.
    We are not a university, but I could make university jackets.
    I would also like to design a better logo for our school.
    A catchy logo that stands out from other schools.</p>
